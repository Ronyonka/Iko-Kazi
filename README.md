# IkoKazi

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.3.
This README.md file provides a step-by-step guide on setting up and running the Angular project "Iko-Kazi." Follow the instructions below to get your development environment up and running.

## 1. Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:

- **Node.js:** Angular requires Node.js. Download and install it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). You will require NodeJS v18.13+ to be able to install Angular

- **npm (Node Package Manager):** npm is included with Node.js. However, make sure you have the latest version by running:

  ```bash
  npm install -g npm@latest
## 2. Set Up and Installation
To set up the Angular project, you need to clone the repository. Follow these steps:

- Open your terminal or command prompt.

- Run the following command to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ronyonka/Iko-Kazi
```
- Change to the project directory:

```bash
cd Iko-Kazi
```
- Install project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```
This will install all the necessary packages and dependencies required for the project.

## 3. Starting it up

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## 4. Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## 5. Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## 6. Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
